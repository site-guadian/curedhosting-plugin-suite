# Cured Hosting Plugin Suite

The Cured Hosting Plugin Suite provides a set of WordPress plugins and modules for hosting businesses: an admin settings UI, license management and validation, a guided setup wizard, and Stripe payment integration. It's designed to be drop-in for WordPress sites and extendable by developers.

Short description: Cured Hosting Plugin Suite — WordPress admin tools, license management, setup wizard, and Stripe payments.

Features
-
- Admin UI and settings pages
- License activation, validation, and auto-renew hooks
- Setup wizard for first-time install and configuration
- Stripe integration for one-time and subscription payments
- Modular structure for adding new modules (cookie consent, link audit, server tools, etc.)

Quick start
-
1. Copy the `curedhosting-plugin-suite` folder into your WordPress `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin from the WordPress admin Plugins screen.
3. Visit the plugin's settings panel to run the setup wizard and configure license and Stripe settings.

Development notes
-
- Core classes live in `includes/` (admin, license, settings, setup wizard, Stripe integration).
- Additional modules are placed under `othwer/completed-plugins/` and other feature folders.

Suggested repository topics: WordPress, plugin, PHP, Stripe, licensing, hosting, onboarding, admin

See also: `othwer/README.html` for historical notes and module-specific docs.

## Standalone Key Maker

A standalone key maker app lives in `key-maker/`.
It can generate license keys outside WordPress using a simple CLI:

```bash
php key-maker/generate-key.php --email="customer@example.com" --tier=pro
```

Use `--secret` to provide an optional shared secret for reproducible key generation.

## Suites

- **Full suite**: contains the core plugin plus all modules, including `key-maker`, `modules/stripe-payment-module`, `modules/wp-server-guardian`, and `modules/wp-speed-autopilot`.
- **Freemium suite**: a reduced package intended for public distribution — it excludes premium modules such as `key-maker`, `modules/stripe-payment-module`, `modules/wp-server-guardian`, and `modules/wp-speed-autopilot`.

Use the freemium build to distribute a lightweight, free edition while keeping premium features in the full release.

## Building release zips

A PowerShell build script `build.ps1` is provided at the repository root to produce versioned release archives. The script reads the version from `curedhosting-plugin-suite.php` and creates two zip files named using the version:

- `curedhosting-plugin-suite-full-<version>.zip`
- `curedhosting-plugin-suite-freemium-<version>.zip`

Run the build locally from the repository root:

```powershell
Set-Location 'd:\PREMIUM PLUGIN\curedhosting-plugin-suite'
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build.ps1
```

The freemium zip excludes the following paths by default: `key-maker`, `modules/stripe-payment-module`.
Premium modules that are part of the paid offering (for example `modules/wp-server-guardian` and `modules/wp-speed-autopilot`) are included inside the freemium archive under a `paid-modules/` folder so they are present but clearly separated from the free modules.
